# üìù Automatic Text Summarization Using Machine Learning and NLP

This is the official repository for my final-year undergraduate research project, focused on automatic text summarization using hybrid NLP and machine learning techniques.

## üîç Abstract

This project explores a hybrid approach to automatic text summarization, combining extractive (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) and abstractive (T5 transformer) methods. Several ML models including RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM were evaluated. Bi-LSTM achieved the best RMSE of 0.0349. This work was completed as part of my B.E. IT degree at Don Bosco Institute of Technology, and is published as a preprint on Zenodo.
